There are a few operations that do not classify as either an intermediate operation or a terminal operation. These are shown in the table below:

[width="100%", cols="2", options="header"]
|==========================================================
| Operation         | Action
| `isParallel`      | Returns `true` if the Stream is parallel, else `false`
| `close`           | Closes the `Stream` and releases all its resources (if any)
|==========================================================

== isParallel

[source,java]
----
    Stream.of("B", "A", "C", "B")
        .parallel()
        .isParallel()
----
returns `true` because the `Stream` is parallel.

[source,java]
----
    Stream.of("B", "A", "C", "B")
        .sequential()
        .isParallel()
----
returns `false` because the `Stream` is *not* parallel.

== close

[source,java]
----
    Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("B", "A", "C", "B");
    stream.forEachOrdered(System.out::println);
    stream.close();
----
prints all elements in the `Stream` and then closes the `Stream`. Some streams (e.g. streams from files) need to be closed to release their resources. Use the try-with-resource patterns if the `Stream` must be closed:

[source,java]
----
    try (Stream<String> s = Stream.of("B", "A", "C", "B")) {
        s.forEachOrdered(System.out::println);
    }
----
