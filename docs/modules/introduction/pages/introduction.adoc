This chapter provides an overview of the JPAStreamer toolkit and its abilities.

== What is JPAStreamer?

JPA Streamer is a lightweight extension for any JPA provider that allows creation of Java Streams from database content. With a single dependency, your application can immediately operate on database elements using standard Stream operators e.g. filter(), sort() and map().

For example, starting with a standard JPA Entity you can effortlessly derive intuitive stream queries:

[source, java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name = "film", schema = "sakila")
public class Film implements Serializable {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "film_id", nullable = false, updatable = false, columnDefinition = "smallint(5)")
    private Integer filmId;

    @Column(name = "title", nullable = false, columnDefinition = "varchar(255)")
    private String title;

    @Column(name = "length", columnDefinition = "smallint(5)")
    private Integer length;

    @Column(name = "rating", columnDefinition = "enum('G','PG','PG-13','R','NC-17')")
    private String rating;
}
----
To operate on the elements of the table, JPAStreamer is first initialized with a simple builder (in this case using a persistence unit named "sakila"):

[source, java]
----
JPAStreamer jpaStreamer = JPAStreamer.createJPAStreamerBuilder("sakila")
.build();
----

The obtained streamer is then used to create Streams that are rendered to database queries through JPA. For example:

[source, java]
----
jpaStreamer.stream(Film.class)
    .filter(Film$.rating.equal("G")) #<1>
    .sorted(Film$.length.reversed().thenComparing(Film$.title.comparator())) #<1>
    .skip(10)
    .limit(5)
    .forEach(System.out::println);
----
<1> Film$ is automatically generated from the Film-table Entity at compile-time by JPAStreamer.

This will print films rated G in reversed length order (where films of equal length will be in title order) but skipping the first ten and then printing only the following five films.

TIP: More examples are available in the chapter xref:fetching-data:stream-examples.adoc[Stream Examples].

Using JPAStreamer, you can quickly create modern and robust web application. All components are pre-tested and work in all major browsers (see Compatibility and Versioning or the release notes). This allows you to spend your development time on your application, not testing with a large combination of different devices, browsers, and operating systems. When you do want to create tests, Vaadin has got you covered with a purpose-built tool, Vaadin TestBench.
