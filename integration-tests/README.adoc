= Integration Test

The tests assume that you are running the Sakila database as a Docker instance on port 3306. See simple installation instructions below.

== Sakila Database 
The tests makes use of the link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/[MySQL Sakila database]. It can either be downloaded from Oracle as described link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html[here] or used directly via a link:https://hub.docker.com/r/restsql/mysql-sakila/[Sakila Docker instance] by issuing the following commands:

[shell script]
----
$ docker pull restsql/mysql-sakila
----

[shell script]
----
$ docker run -d --publish 3306:3306 --name mysqld restsql/mysql-sakila
----

NOTE: This Docker image does not support ARM64 architecture, thus if you are running on e.g. an M1 Mac, you need to emulate an Intel image by adding the flag `--platform linux/amd64` after `docker run` in the above command. This may not always work ideally, learn more about why at the link:https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/apple-silicon/#known-issues[Docker webpage].
